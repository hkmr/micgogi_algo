//Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of
//index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in
//proportion to its weight.
//
//Note:
//
//1 <= w.length <= 10000
//1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
//pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
//Example 1:
//
//Input:
//["Solution","pickIndex"]
//[[[1]],[]]
//Output: [null,0]
//Example 2:
//
//Input:
//["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
//[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
//Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
//Explanation of Input Syntax:
//
//The input is two lists: the subroutines
// called and their arguments. Solution's
// constructor has one argument, the array w.
// pickIndex has no arguments.
// Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
